		In conclusion, a pattern did occur across all the key metrics displayed in <thead>
			analysis, which was that activity did see a boost at and the coming days after the launch of
			Station, but only the see a decline back to levels similar to the week beforehand. One
			interesting discovery that stood out was that the volume of LUNA that was being redelgated
			after the launch, which was quite substantial, and can suggest that there were an amount of
			LUNA holders with a fair amount of LUNA sitting in their wallets idle, receiving a push to
			stake their LUNA once again with the launch of the new wallet.
			<br /><br />
			Overall, quite a positive response from the ecosystem to the launch of the new Station wallet,
			but I must add, the price of LUNA has done extremely well over the same time period, which may
			well be a significant factor into the activity observed, so it may be wise to not give the launch
			of the new wallet all the credit.
